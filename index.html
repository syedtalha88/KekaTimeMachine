		<h2>2015 – The Beginning</h2>
        <p>It all started in a tiny room filled with big dreams and even bigger coffee mugs. Payroll nightmares were rampant, and we knew something had to change.</p>
<p>No fancy setups, no shiny tech—just a handful of rebels with laptops, trying to fix HR with code and sheer willpower.</p>
<p>And thus, Keka was born. From chaos came clarity, and from caffeine came creativity.</p>

			<h2>2016 – Early Adopters</h2>
<p>The first 100 customers joined us on this crazy ride. They didn’t just use the platform—they believed in it.</p>
<p>Our celebrations weren’t extravagant, but samosas and a team high-five felt like winning a startup Oscar.</p>
<p>Every bit of feedback became a feature, and every bug squashed brought us closer to greatness.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>2017 – Product Expansion</h2>
<p>This year, we expanded our horizons. Performance reviews, goal tracking, and employee engagement tools rolled out like confetti.</p>
<p>Employees appreciated the clarity. Managers... well, they had mixed feelings—but deep down, they knew it was needed.</p>
<p>Keka transformed from a payroll tool to an all-in-one HR suite. It wasn’t evolution—it was a glow-up.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="section right">
			<h2>2018 – Gaining Momentum</h2>
<p>We crossed 1,000 customers—and with it, our servers learned what stress truly means.</p>
<p>Our engineering team became nocturnal. Support tickets became love letters. And Slack emojis became our second language.</p>
<p>Every milestone felt like magic. Every crash became a lesson. We were learning fast, and growing even faster.</p>

			<h2>2020 – Remote Revolution</h2>
<p>The pandemic flipped the world upside down. But Keka stood firm.</p>
<p>We turned remote chaos into organized calm. From virtual onboarding to WFH attendance, our tools kept teams connected and HR sane.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes? Zoom calls in pajamas, productivity in slippers, and a fridge that never stayed full.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section dark length">
			<h2>2021 – Scaling Fast</h2>
<p>With 5,000+ customers now onboard, Keka was no longer a best-kept secret—it was the new HR standard.</p>
<p>Our infrastructure scaled, our features matured, and our coffee intake doubled. Again.</p>
<p>Every success story felt personal. We weren’t just growing—we were helping others grow too.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section dark wingspan">
			<h2>2022 – Global Reach</h2>
<p>Keka passports stamped across continents. Bonjour, Namaste, and Hola became daily greetings.</p>
<p>Global clients brought diverse needs, and we answered with flexible, intelligent solutions.</p>
<p>Whether in Bangalore or Berlin, we proved that great HR tech knows no borders.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section dark phalange">
			<h2>2023 – Product Renaissance</h2>
<p>This year was all about reinvention. A shiny new UI. Dashboards that even data-haters adored. Automation so smooth, it felt like magic.</p>
<p>Feedback drove innovation. Design met function. And spreadsheets everywhere wept quietly in the corner.</p>
<p>Keka became more than usable—it became lovable.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="section dark">
			<h2>2024 – Culture First</h2>
<p>Beyond tools and tech, we focused on what really matters—people.</p>
<p>Happiness scores, wellness initiatives, and culture dashboards weren’t just nice-to-haves—they became essential.</p>
<p>We measured engagement. Encouraged breaks. And celebrated small wins (and chai breaks) like champions.</p>
